# THE ADVENTURE AWAITS
You stand before the abandoned mansion known as Pirates House, once home to the infamous Captain Blackbeard. Legend tells of fabulous treasures hidden within its walls - a chest of GOLD and a priceless GEM, lost for over a century.  
But beware! The house guards its secrets well. A dangerous pirate still prowls the Captain's Quarters, deadly traps await the unwary explorer, and puzzles left by Blackbeard himself must be solved before the treasure can be claimed.
